## Instructions

### Start in Workspace

1. Initialize the git repo
```bash
git init
```

2. Configure your name and email
```bash
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

3. Add and commit existing files:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
```
Your Workspace terminal should look something like this:
![Workspace Terminal](./images/demo-repo-workspace.jpg)


### Go to **[GitHub.com](https://github.com/)** and log in:

4. Create a new repository

5. Do _not_ check the "Initialize this repository with a README" radio button
   Create a new repository
![GitHub initialize new repo](./images/demo-repo-initialize.jpg?raw=true)

6. On the next page, copy the code in the ***push an existing repository from the command line*** section:
&nbsp;  
![GitHub setup remote](./images/demo-repo-push.jpg)



### Go back to Workspace

7.  Paste in the terminal:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-name/yourrepo.git
git push -u origin master
```

8.  Enter your GitHub username and password when prompted:
![Workspace Terminal](./images/demo-repo-workspace-2.jpg)

1. Go to the root of the project and delete the repo with this code:

rm -fr .git
```
